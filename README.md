# Patterns
There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns.  
Patterns hidden by patterns.  
Patterns within patterns.  
If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself.  
What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized.  
What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher.  
what we can't understand we call nonsense.  
What we can't read we call gibberish.
